inspector panel: infobox-settings -> image or Icon -> number ->  number input-field attribute must be string type. Because of the issue: when number is 0 it doesn't show in the frontend
-------------------- changes -------------
1) attributes.js: margin-padding attributes type changed to string and added the tab/mobile attributes for responsive options
2) constants: added 'FONT_SIZE_UNITS' (actually: px/em/%) and imported in inspector for reuse
3) helpers.js: it's brought here for using later
4) ResPanelBody.js: it's brought here and used in 'margin-padding' panel of inspector
5) inspector.js: 'margin-padding' responsive option added, haven't implemented them yet
6) subodule:'dimensions-control' from 'hanzala-dev' checked-out and used
-------------------- changes -------------
1) attributes.js: default padding value given for desktop padding attributes
2) edit.js: css by strings implemented for 'infobox-wrapper' with reponsive options 
3) inspector.js: "iconPosition" options cleaned as there're only two options for "iconPosition"
4) unnecessary codes removed from "style.scss". Soon no styles will be in this file
